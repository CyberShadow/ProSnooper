New in ProSnooper 2.0 final (build 201):

- "Disable autoscroll" switch added. A lot of people
  apparently didn't like this feature introduced in
  build 200. You can disable autoscroll again by activating
  this switch.
  Note that the Find feature in the chatbox will be
  broken if this isn't enabled.
- ProSnooper now displays the topic correctly.


  For people still using the old 1.x and 2.0 build 191
  it is highly recommended to update to this version
  because of the performance fixes.
 
  Also, if you're using Windows Vista, the only way to
  host or join games through ProSnooper is to use build 
  200 or 201 and specify a custom path to WA.exe.

New in ProSnooper 2.0 Beta 2 (build 200):

- Performance issues fixed.
- URLs in the chatbox are now clickable
- Icons updated.
- Auto-scroll workaround implemented for the chat box.
  The chat box will now only scroll automatically
  if the scroll bar is placed at the bottom.
- You can now specify a custom path to wA.exe
  for joining and hosting games.
  If not set, ProSnooper will use the wa:// protocol
  handler.
- Find Dialog has been added to the chat box again
- It is no longer possible for other clients 
  to use the Buddy and Ignore status symbols as 
  normal flags.
- ProSnooper will show INVITEs, Invalid Target-
  messages, topic changes and mode changes.
- ProSnooper will raise the delay of getting the 
  gamelist to one minute while you are marked as 
  away.
- Exception errors when updating the gamelist fixed

New in ProSnooper 2.0 Beta 1 (build 191):

- It is now possible to connect to other W:A servers.
- A server list that can be updated to list new servers.
- Away-log which allows you to see messages and highlights
  received when using the /away command.
- W:A-style color codes (\r, \b) are now displayed.
- W:A-style game list
- The "View details"-menu now displays the GameID and the
  game hoster.
- Channel list (which will also be displayed in case the
  channel selected in the Login dialog doesn't exist on
  the server)
- You can now set the GameID and the Scheme parameters
  when hosting a Direct IP game from ProSnooper.
- ProSnoopers Tray Icon will now blink if you are high-
  lighted or messaged.
- The away-system sometimes failed; this has been fixed.
- Spam protection for the "Send away reason on..." features
- The command /quote which can send "raw" IRC commands.
  Note: this command will desynchronize the user list when
  commands like JOIN are used.
- Ukrainian flag added. Apparantly I forgot to add this in
  earlier versions.
- "New flags"-fix for W:A. Note: Because of the flag fixes, 
  there will be problems for earlier versions of ProSnooper 
  to display flags and ranks.
- The sound alerts will no longer freeze ProSnooper.

New in ProSnooper 1.1.0:

  the game is no longer valid; the "remove game" button 
  is removed

- The ability to change the font size
- New default color scheme (to reset to defaults, remove 
  the registry entry for prosnooper)

  start.
